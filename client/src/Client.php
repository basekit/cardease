 * CardEaseXML is a flexible client-server framework for processing credit
 * and debit card transactions over an internet connection.
 * <p>&copy; 2005-2007 CreditCall Communications Ltd
 * <p><center><b><a href="../TermsAndConditions.htm">TERMS AND CONDITIONS</a></b></center>
 * <p>
 * It has the
 * ability to handle manual, magnetic stripe and EMV details for a number
 * of different request types such as authorisations and refunds.
 * <p>
 * To facilitate the use of CardEaseXML, CreditCall manage a set of secure
 * servers which accept XML formatted messages over a TCP/IP connection which
 * describe the required transactions.
 * <p>
 * There are essentially three ways of communicating with the CreditCall
 * CardEaseXML servers; SSL connection, HTTPS connection or by using an
 * established SDK made available by CreditCall. These SDKs are supported
 * by detailed protocol documentation and a test environment under which
 * integration can be performed.
 * <p>
 * Using an SDK developed by CreditCall allows for quicker integration as it
 * is using a code base that has been tested to conform to the CardEaseXML
 * protocol.
 * <p>
 * At this time client SDKs are available for the following development
 * platforms:
 * <ul>
 *	<li>COM/ActiveX
 *	<li>Java 1.4
 *	<li>Java 1.5
 *	<li>.NET 1.1
 *	<li>.NET 2.0
 *  <li>Perl
 *	<li>PHP
 * </ul>
 * This documentation describes the interfaces for using the PHP SDK,
 * it does not provide a detailed CardEaseXML protocol description, or
 * documentation regarding other SDKs. These are available separately from
 * CreditCall.
 * <p>
 * The PHP SDK has the following dependencies:
 * <ul>
 *	<li>PHP 4.0.2+/5.x
 *  <li>PHP Curl Support
 *  <li>PHP XML Support
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Registration to use CardEaseXML can be performed by visiting this web
 * site and completely the necessary form:
 * <p>
 * <a href="https://testwebmis.creditcall.com/">https://testwebmis.creditcall.com/</a>
 * <p>
 * During the process of registration it will be necessary to supply a valid
 * email address and choose a password. An email will be sent to the
 * supplied email address which will enable confirmation of registration. 
 * <p>
 * Registration will provide details of a CardEase Terminal ID and a
 * CardEase Transaction Key. It will be necessary to make a note of these as
 * they will be required for integration, testing and using CardEaseXML.
 * <p>
 * Once registration is complete and all of the necessary details have been
 * obtained, development can proceed.
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE: Due to the error handling in PHP 4.x, errors should be caught
 * by implementing and registering an appropriate error handler.
 * This error handler should
 * look for errors that start with the prefix "CardEaseXML". All other
 * errors should be forwarded to the default error handler. An example
 * of this can be found in the distributed CardEaseXML PHP examples.</b>

/**
 * This class is used to process requests by sending them
 * to CardEaseXML servers. This client supports PHP 4.x and 5.x.
 * <p>
 * To use the Client a Request object should be created and populated
 * with the necessary transaction information such as the request type and
 * terminal id, as well as any optional information that is required such as a
 * user reference or address verification information.
 * <p>
 * Due to the redundancy available in the CardEase platform, the client can
 * communicate with any number of CardEaseXML servers until a successful
 * connection is made. Therefore, it is necessary to specify the
 * ServerURLs with which you would like the client to communicate
 * with in the order that you would like the communication to occur. Each of the
 * servers will be contacted in turn until a successful request is made.
 * <p>
 * If a connection is successful processing stops and the Response can be
 * retrieved. If a connection is unsuccessful the next host is tried until there
 * are no more available. If the Client runs out of servers to
 * contact, the request fails.
 * <p>
 * A successful request will obtain a Response object from the CardEase
 * platform. The response should be examined for error information and the
 * results of the specified transaction.
